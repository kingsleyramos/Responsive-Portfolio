## Tool & Resources

* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - CSS framework used



## Challenges

The largest challenge was trying to understand how and if I should override some bootstrap components. The homework instructions were not very clear so I had to refer to other classmates if they purely used bootstrap or used custom CSS along with bootstrap. I have found that many of them used custom CSS to override some CSS. 

## Take Away

I've learned how to use the Inspect tool to learn which attributes within bootstrap I can override with my own CSS. After doing this project, I got to understand prioritization within HTML and CSS, as well as create responsive website according to screen size and use media queries.
