c# Homework 2: Responsive-Portfolio

## Project Goal

To create a website from scratch with using Bootstrap components and create a responsive website that changes according to screen width.

## Challenges

The largest challenge was trying to understand how and if I should override some bootstrap components. The homework instructions were not very clear so I had to refer to other classmates if they purely used bootstrap or used custom CSS along with bootstrap. I have found that many of them used custom CSS to override some CSS. 

##Take Aways

I've learned how to use the Inspect tool to learn which attributes within bootstrap I can override with my own CSS. After doing this project, I got to understand prioritization within HTML and CSS, as well as create responsive website according to screen size and use media queries.
